## Proposal for Data Investigation:
Read the data from csv in form of DataFrames
Join two tables by DataFrame join
Look for the missing values, shape and size of DataFrame, Important columns and Summary of each column
If its imputable, impute the missing values
Use only the required columns for analysis to gain on Data Computation
Truncate DataFrame to the period which we are analyzing
Aggregate the data on portions wherever required
Summarize the overall DataFrame and the trucated dataframes to analyze, observe and extract features
Use correlation for feature extraction
Use plots wherever required for analysis
